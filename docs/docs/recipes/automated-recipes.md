Automated recipes are a new tool to automate common site building tasks.

These automated recipes are run from the CLI and automate common tasks like creating pages and layouts, installing and setting up plugins, adding a blog to a site, setting up TypeScript, and many more.

This is a new project announced in [this blogpost](/blog/2020-04-15-announcing-gatsby-recipes/) and that we're tracking in [this umbrella issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/22991).

> Note: [Please contribute!](/contributing/how-to-contribute/) We welcome PRs for new recipes and fixes/improvements to existing recipes.

## Official Gatsby Recipes
[These are the MDX files for the official Recipes](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-recipes/recipes).

## Community Recipes
When you add a new recipe, please also add it to the recipes list at [https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/05151c006974b7636b00f0cd608fac89ddaa1c08/packages/gatsby-recipes/src/cli.js#L60](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/05151c006974b7636b00f0cd608fac89ddaa1c08/packages/gatsby-recipes/src/cli.js#L60).

Note: GitHub doesn't yet support viewing MDX files. In order to view a recipe in the GitHub UI you'll want to click into the recipe file and click on the "Raw" button.
